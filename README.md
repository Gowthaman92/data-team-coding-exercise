# Data team coding exercise

## Background

You've been hired as a data engineer for **PLAYWIBRIX** a company who manufacture plastic components for construction toys.

You've been given two data sets:

`components.csv` - A reference data set containing some information about the components the company manufactures.

`orders.json.txt` - A file containing JSON records, each containing the detail of an order for components.

There are grander plans for this data... but for now you've been tasked to process these data points, and create an output detailing how many units of each coloured component that were ordered on 3rd June 2021.

So just as an example, your output could look like:

```
Red: 500
Orange: 700
...
```

## Notes

Please use Python or Java to complete this exercise. Try to stick to a time limit of around an hour. 

You are free to use any frameworks or libraries as you like. 

Please provide instructions to run your code to produce the output required.

Aside from the practicalities of the exercise, we will be assessing your approach to software engineering.
We'd really love to see a clean, tested, codebase, with a maintainable design.
 
Good luck!
